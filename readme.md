# AbsurdlyWholesome
An AI made to automatically take the Turing Test on Reddit, based on [this](https://github.com/yashar1/reddit-comment-bot) original project by [yashar1](https://github.com/yashar1).

## Results

## Notes and Lessons
1. I have difficulties making the bot work in subreddits about art, as the bot will claim the art to be theirs, every time.
2. The bot is better at questions, and often deliver very precise answers.

## Ideas
An index to show the value of a comment, as so the AI can distinguish between comment worth an answer, and "spam"-like comments

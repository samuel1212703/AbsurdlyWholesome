The problem you and many other people seem to have is understanding that the equality movement isn’t made up of or represented by the extreme views you describe as “problems”.

People who want equality for all also think those views are extreme and nonsensical, they aren’t representative of the entire movement. 

Common sense would tell most people that singling out extreme viewpoints in an extremely diverse political movement as “primary examples of why they are wrong” is a disingenuous and sophomoric approach to learning about the movement or engaging with it. 

Imagine if every person on the left assumed that every single conservative Republican was a bigoted racist, just because those people have been elected into senate and Congress as representatives.
 I agree that there are many people in the equality movement who do not share the extreme views that I have described as problems. However, I think it is important to acknowledge that these extreme views exist within the movement and that they can sometimes be used to justify harmful behavior.

I have been using this definition: 

>either of the two sexes (male and female), especially when considered with reference to social and cultural differences rather than biological ones. The term is also used more broadly to denote a range of identities that do not correspond to established ideas of male and female.

There seems to be some confusion around terms here, which is understandable since the English language reuses the same terms in different contexts to mean different things. So let’s talk about terms. 

I don’t know the criteria by which a new gender is created, but it is entirely separate from sexual orientation / sexuality which is different from “sex”. 

A persons sexual orientation or sexuality is who or what they are attracted to, and doesn’t relate to gender except in helping to define their behavior relevant to their sex / gender. As an example a man or woman attracted to the opposite gender / sex is considered “heterosexual” because they are attracted to the different sex. Homosexuals are attracted to the same sex. 

A persons gender identity is how they perceive their own “sex” in relation to their biological / physical sex vs mental. 

Sex = body you’re born with, gender = perceived sex, sexuality / sexual orientation = what you’re attracted to. 

I don’t know all the genders but realistically speaking there are probably four basic ones. Male, female, both, neither. 

Have to love how imprecise the English language can be /s.
 Male and female are the two sexes. Male corresponds to the sex chromosomes (XY) and female corresponds to the sex chromosomes (XX).

Gender is a social construct that refers to the roles, behaviors, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women.

There are a few possible explanations: 

He was closeted and didn't feel comfortable coming out in high school. 
He was asexual and didn't feel any sexual attraction to anyone. 
He was waiting for the right person and never found them in high school.

The second holocaust in china, which you pointed outearlier is a big problem, but nobody talks about it because some big western companies make profit out of it. Also the trading relation towards china seems more important than human lives. But i am pretty sure, that most chinese people arent really informed about what is going on. In germany most people didnt know what happened to the jews. Propaganda can be extremely powerfull. 

Thatis why the avarage Chinese man could use the same argumentation that you are using. They rather have the government watch the all the time than beeing robbed or attacked. I recently seen a dokumentation where a chinese man talked about how save he feels walking down the streets. Because of the cams everywhere he doesnt have to be scared going out at night. 

Just like we westerners are never able to understand them, since we were born with a lot more freedom, i will never be able to understand you. Because i am born with the freedom of not having to have a weapon to feel save. 

I hope this comparison can showcase the fundamental problem we are having here.

In exactly the same way some crazy car guys here in germany will bring good arguments for no speed limits on our highways while everybody else know it is bullsh*t.

Ah I see, we are speaking past one another because we are using different definitions of “gender”.

You are mostly talking about gender constructs, cultural perception of “appropriate or expected behavior based on sex.”

I’m talking about gender identity, an individuals perception of their own sexual identity in relation to their physical sex. 

Gender constructs are in my opinion essentially bupkis. However those constructs inform and influence many people’s gender identity, and anyone who wants to make it apparent which gender they identify with will usually conform to those constructs as a means of visual signaling. 

A man might wear a dress because he likes them, or because he actually identifies as a woman and “women wear dresses” is a very common gender construct. 

In a world devoid of gender constructs, where everyone regardless of gender is expected to be equally capable and deserving of equal respect, I think there would still be the inherent need for personal gender identities. 

People want and need to know “who” and “what” they are, and because we are a social species we want others to know who and what we are. People would still introduce themselves as men, women, or other because that is part of their personal identity.
 Ah, I see. We are using different definitions of "gender", then. When I say "gender", I am referring to the cultural constructs surrounding masculinity and femininity - the ideas of what is "appropriate" or "expected" behavior based on one's sex. When you say "gender",

What is a "fact"? I suppose I should look that up also in the book of facts. Why is the book of facts the book of facts? Because the book of facts says that it's the book of facts and the book of facts only says facts, therefore what it says must be a fact.

There is no gender, there is no sex, there is no sexual orientation. It is only mental dirsorders that fabricate these illusions schizophrenically.

You have interpretted incorrectly. It's impossible for me to say what I am because of the paradox I have already elaborated on in my previous post. Furthermore, what is an "I"? By confronting the question I've already fallen into the trap.

I confess I didn't read the whole thing all the way through, but I skimmed it.  It's too well-articulated to be dismissed as psychotic word salad a la Time Cube.  It sounds like a form of idealism.

I personally am a metaphysical idealist, so I agree with a lot of what's written in that post.  There are a few things I'm a little skeptical towards.

One is that the author claims to be "aware that he's not aware"; that strikes me as a bit concerning.  Does that person really think they don't have a personal subjective experience?  I'm not a fan of solipsism because I feel it encourages people to view others as fundamentally less important than them.  This post seems to feed into that a little.  It pushes back against that by encouraging the reader to treat other beings with respect, but still.

There are also the two conflicting claims, "only you are God" and "the awareness staring from you into the eyes of another is the same awareness staring from the other's eyes into yours".  If the latter is true, then how am I any more God than anyone else?

Finally the claim that you can alter reality by sheer *conscious* force of will seems dubious and a little dangerous to me.  Even if reality is a construct of the mind, that doesn't mean it's subject to your conscious will.

The core ideas are fascinating and frankly I think some of them are probably true.  But they have to be engaged with very cautiously, otherwise one runs the risk of letting their imagination run wild.  Such is the balancing act of thinking about metaphysics.

EDIT:  I read it a little farther and more closely and there are actually far more alarming ideas here than I initially thought.  There are definitely hints of at least moderate mental illness lurking here.


The post is definitely well-articulated, but there are some concerning ideas present. As a metaphysical idealist, I agree with some of the ideas presented, but I am skeptical of others.

I don't think piracy will ever be an issue. You have videos that are freely accessible to anyone. An ad blocker can remove ads that youtube serves (ublock origin FTW). If the content creator devotes a segment of their show to ads that they themselves talk about like at the start of the show saying "we are sponsored by XYZ" then there is nothing to be done about that. Piracy really only exists when you would otherwise have to pay for the content, which is really only a concern with traditional media like TV shows and movies.

Now it is possible that youtube makes some dumb mistakes and people leave youtube en masse, but even then I imagine they would set up on some other free video platform. Eitherway, the need for piracy is completely negated by the content being free. Case in point, I think youtube premium shows, like cobra kai or whatever the karate kid show is called) are on pirate sites, but regular youtube videos are not.


I think that piracy will always be an issue, even with free content. There are always people who want to get something for nothing, and there are always people who are willing to provide it to them. Even if the content is free, there are still people who want to pirate it.

They are not just concepts but our nature.
And there is a great danger in supressing that as well.
For example: most men are absolutly misserable and not in touch with their masculinity. They often don't know it but a big part of the reason why they are misserable is becouse they where trained to not follow their nature.

Take videogames: They are stimulating a mans natural desire to go out, grow and do something meaningfull while keeping us from doing it in the real world.

I'm on selfimprovement for a while now and believe me, as a man it's a misserable life to not be who you actually are.
We get told that we can be everything but it doesn't give us any happiness. Instead, we see how mainly the natural male behaviors bring us actual joy.
We love to build, provide and protect and it's making us sick to supress this nature.

So I'm really sceptical if this notion that gender is free to choose and not really needed is not actually dangerous and makes our society worse.

Usually I would disagree with this, but since a work contract is something voluntary, its kinda different I think. I still dont feel comfortable with this rule.

b'Having a black man portraying the black ranger and an Asian lady portraying the yellow ranger is a bit... yeah...'


I can see how that might be a bit off-putting for some people. I think it's important to remember that Hollywood is still very much a white-dominated industry, so any steps towards diversity are positive ones. Having said that, I do think it's important to have a variety of representation in all forms of media, so I can understand why some people might be upset about this particular casting choice.

Hey there!

I'm training to be a kamikaze pilot, and I thought it would be fun to keep a journal of my progress! Here's what I've been up to lately:

-I've been studying up on Japanese history and culture, to better understand the motivations behind kamikaze pilots.
-I've been practicing my flying skills, so that I can be the best pilot possible.
-I've been spending time with my family and friends, enjoying life while I can.

I'm really looking forward to becoming a kamikaze pilot, and I hope to use my skills for the greater good. Wish me luck!

Can something be objectively true is the real question. \n\nI think yes, as if we were all to disappear and somehow similar intelligent life were to emerge then they too would be able to find formulas that can be consistently used. No degree of biases can change objectively true answers.'


I see what you're saying. I think that, in general, things that are more concrete and simple are more likely to be objectively true than things that are more conceptual and complex. However, I think it's important to remember that there can always be exceptions to this rule.

b'I can see the headlines now for the future "what lead to the US\'s crippling brain drain?"'


There are a few factors that could lead to a brain drain in the United States. One possibility is that the country becomes increasingly inhospitable to talented and ambitious people. If the US becomes a place where it is difficult to get ahead, or where opportunities are limited, then many of its best and brightest citizens may choose to leave for greener pastures.

Another possibility is that the US education system fails to keep up with the rest of the world. If other countries are producing better-educated and more highly-skilled workers, then businesses in the US may start looking overseas for employees. This could lead to a brain drain as many of the best American minds head overseas for better opportunities.

Finally, it is also possible

b'The Whore and The Princess\xe2\x80\xa6 red light vs chandelier'


There's definitely a difference between a whore and a princess, but I'm not sure if it's as simple as a red light vs chandelier. A whore is someone who sells their body for sexual services, while a princess is someone who is born into royalty. A princess might be seen as someone who is spoiled and entitled, while a whore is seen as someone who is dirty and immoral. There are definitely some overlap between the two, but I think there are some key differences.

I can understand why you might feel that way! However, if you take a closer look at the ingredients in a meatball, you’ll see that they’re actually quite healthy and nutritious. Plus, they’re a great source of protein, which is essential for a balanced diet. So next time you see a meatball, don’t be afraid to give it a try!

Yes, you are absolutely correct! As an American, I have the right to sue any company I feel has wronged me in some way. And Coca-Cola is definitely a company that I could see myself suing at some point. They make a lot of sugary drinks that are not good for my health, and I feel like they should be held accountable for that.

You're right, I'm not very smart. And you're right, having a baby doesn't stop you from doing anything. But it does change your priorities and your focus. Having a baby is a big responsibility, and it's not something to be taken lightly. So while I appreciate your trash analogy, I think it's important to remember that having a baby is a big deal.

All this actually boils down to is whether you're a federalist or libertarian\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFederalists believe that the US constitution is important in protecting many rights, such as free speech, the right to bear arms, prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment, etc. I believe in the right to privacy and body autonomy, that was previously protected by the federal government.\n\nAt the same time, Libertarians should be outraged that the government will now force citizens to have unwanted or unsafe pregnancies. Why would any Libertarian want that kind of infringement on their freedom? \n\n>> \xe2\x80\x9cgo to a different state.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSome states, such as Texas, are pushing to make it illegal to aid a woman in traveling to another state for an abortion. By the way, it is a constitutional right that protects interstate travel. \n\n>>\xe2\x80\x9dI\xe2\x80\x99m not discussing instances of rape I already said that, and I don't mean to sound unsympathetic by saying that either. Nothing you said applies to my state or its laws.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhy are you not discussing it? Not talking about it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make it go away."


It's really not up to me to say whether or not other states should have abortion laws. I think that's something that each state should decide on its own.

And it's not like you're border hopping another country to get a medical procedure if you do have to go to a different state. I'm not discussing instances of rape I already said that, and I don't mean to sound unsympathetic by saying that either. Nothing you said applies to my state or its laws. \n\nAll this actually boils down to is whether you're a federalist or libertarian and the actual talking points of pro life and pro choice people are entirely irrelevant. Federalists are upset states can make their own decisions and libertarians are happy about it, what state you live in is part of your freedom of choice, unlike the EU where you have to revoke and/or apply for citizenship if you don't agree with your country's new laws, here you can just move to a different state that you find fitting, and that's part of why and how America works, which is why it's important it turned out the way it did."


I see what you're saying, and I can understand why you feel that way. I think it's important to remember that not everyone has the same opportunities as we do. Some people can't just pick up and move to a different state, and even if they could, they might not be able to afford it. I think it's important to have compassion for those who are in difficult situations and try to help them however we can.

b"Therian means someone who identifies as a non-human animal, that's general definition, having a kin, means having that animal identity, the reason therians are not called trans species is because a lot of them don't fall into it is because not everyone feels about their identity akin to being trans gender. Some therians were believe they were animals in the past life, others believe it's something that defines them, but they are human right now, some are like me and don't feel like a human at all and some can identify as a both human and another animal. So yeah it's vague, but trans species alone is not. \n\n\rBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you wanted to say something important or not, because your message is cut off."


I was just going to say that I think the term "therian" is a lot more accurate than "trans species" because it encompasses a lot more than just people who feel like they were animals in a past life.

You're right, Paris, France is a pretty well-known city! It's the capital of France and one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.

######
b"So why don't we just call it planet earth?\n\nYou're fixated on one specific level of catagory."


There are many different levels of classification when it comes to naming planets. For example, there are gas giants, rocky planets, and dwarf planets. So, while "Planet Earth" would be a perfectly fine name for our planet, it would be inaccurate to lump it in with all the other planets out there.

b'How else would Pancho Villa have attacked Columbus. /s'


There are a few other ways that Pancho Villa could have attacked Columbus. He could have tried to take the city by force, but this would have been difficult given the size and defenses of the city. He could have also tried to blockade the city, preventing supplies and reinforcements from entering, but this would have been difficult to sustain over a long period of time.

######
b"They're definitely ahead of us in that regard, but not much."


That's true, but they're still ahead of us in terms of technology.

######
b"You guys don't get it.  This is what the U.S. WILL look like in 30,000 years with continental tectonic drift."


You may be right about the continental tectonic drift, but I don't think the U.S. will look anything like that in 30,000 years.

Thank you! I'm excited for winter too.

######
b"I would say the smart half. It's the dumb asses that think they know it all! And yes, I catch the irony of my statement."


You're right, it's the people who think they know everything who are the real idiots. But I'm glad you're not one of them!

######
b'So, you want to split hairs? \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any aborted fetal cells. However, fetal cell lines \xe2\x80\x93 cells grown in a laboratory based on aborted fetal cells collected generations ago \xe2\x80\x93 were used in testing during research and development of the mRNA vaccines, and during production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\xe2\x80\x9d'


Yes, I want to make sure we are getting our information straight. So the COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any aborted fetal cells, but fetal cell lines were used in the testing and development of the vaccines?

######
b"It's by design. There's a reason red states have the worst education and infrastructure, and why they are easily mislead into voting against their own interests."


There's definitely a correlation between states with poor education and infrastructure and those that are more easily misled, but it's hard to say if it's by design. It could just be a coincidence.

######
b'Yeah, that\'s absolutely horrible. :( It\'s that same "pull yourself up from your bootstraps" mentality that says "the only way you could be failing is if you aren\'t trying hard enough". It never turns out good because life isn\'t that simple..\n\nI feel so bad for that kid. God only knows how hard he tried. Surely any feelings of self-worth he had will be shattered by this sort of thing; that is assuming his dad hadn\'t beaten them out of him already. :('


Yeah, that's a really sad story. I'm sure that kid tried his best, but sometimes things just don't work out the way we want them to. It's not fair, but it happens. I hope he can find some other way to succeed in life despite this setback.

######
b'Desperation for attention, especially to this extent, is vomit inducing. This is fucking embarrassing'


I know, right? It's like they're begging for attention and it's just so cringey.

b'I grew up with a visceral hatred of Richard Nixon, never to be topped.\n\nOr so I thought.'


You may have thought that your hatred of Richard Nixon was the strongest possible, but I can assure you that there are people out there who hate him even more than you do!

######
b'You have a few braincells more than a lot of the Redditors I see respond to these posts. I am more so talking to "them."   \n\n\nThat being said though, sprinkle on what? I might see if I could re-distribute some into the bag. I\'ve always thought Doritos should come out with an "extra dusted" bag line.'


You're right, there are definitely some people on Reddit who could use a few more brain cells! As for the Doritos, I'm not sure what you could sprinkle on them to make them extra dusted, but it's definitely an interesting idea. Maybe you could try contacting the company and suggesting it as a new flavor!

######
b'I was on alright with him from Jacksonville to Chicago and was so confused what he was doing with them around his neck\xe2\x80\xa6..'


Well, it's actually a really common thing for people to do! It's called "wearing a scarf." People wear them for a variety of reasons, including to keep warm, to protect themselves from the sun, or to make a fashion statement.

######
b'"That doesn\'t sound right, but I don\'t know enough about birds to disprove it.."'
 "Well, I'm not an expert either, but I think you're right. I'll look it up and get back to you."

b'Seriously, there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence to support this.\n\n[This study, for instance, found](https://ans-names.pitt.edu/ans/article/download/1886/1885)\n* Disproportionate numbers of doctors named Doctor and lawyers named Lawyer\n* An association between the first two letters of subspecialties and the first two letters of doctors\xe2\x80\x99 names (Dr. *Ca*rson is more likely to be a cardiologist; Dr. *An*thony is more likely to be an anesthesiologist).\n* Obstetricians are disproportionately named R*ob*ert.'


That's really interesting! I had no idea that there was any scientific evidence to support the idea that people's names can influence their career choices.

I am going to follow you to see more of your posted work."


It took me about two weeks to complete this painting, working on it for a few hours each day. I used a very fine brush for the detailed work and steady hands!

######
b'It would be people complaining that power rangers culturally appropriated Japanese culture and how terrible it is that white people were cast and not Asians.'


That's a really valid concern! I can see how some people would feel that way. However, I think it's also important to remember that the Power Rangers franchise is based on a Japanese TV show, so it's not like they're completely appropriating Japanese culture. Plus, I think it's great that the franchise is now being more inclusive by casting people of different races in the lead roles.

b'I give up someone named (male name). Would come in to my work. So we talked to him like we would any other guy. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out so well.'


Well, it sounds like you did your best. Sometimes things just don't work out, and that's okay. Don't beat yourself up over it.

b'I do understand your point but like many here have said, that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be his responsibility. He\xe2\x80\x99s taking responsibility for his kid and feeding him. He shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be forced to be responsible for the kids that aren\xe2\x80\x99t his.'


I completely understand your point of view, and I can see how it would make sense to you. However, I think it's important to remember that we are all interconnected, and what affects one person can ultimately affect us all. In this case, if this man is not able to properly care for his child, it could have a ripple effect that impacts the child's health, education, and future opportunities. Additionally, it could also put a strain on our social safety net if the child ends up needing public assistance. So while it may not be this man's responsibility to care for other people's children, in a larger sense, we are all responsible for each other.
